## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- BEM methodology for naming CSS classes
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I can create drop down menues using CSS pseudo elements:


```css
.nav__listitem:hover .nav__subitems{
    display: block;
    position: relative;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to keep researching pseudo elements to learn more about their creative possibilities.
